# Bank Account Management System
This code is an example of a bank account management system that is built using JavaScript. It simulates the functionality of a bank account, including displaying account information, making transfers, and taking out loans. The code defines four bank accounts with different properties such as owner, movements, interestRate and pin.

The code uses JavaScript's Document Object Model (DOM) to interact with the elements of the web page. It uses the querySelector() method to select various elements of the HTML page and assigns them to variables.

The code uses various functions to perform different actions, such as displaying account movements, calculating the balance of an account, and displaying summary information. It also uses event listeners to handle user interactions, such as button clicks, and updates the page accordingly.
